Nagios
======

Nagios plugins and scripts that I've written over time and now
want to share with you. There are a lot of quite simple scripts
here, but they might help you.


Most SSH based scripts have been developed during my time at a
bigger company, where we had root SSH keys on all machines.


Most SNMP based scripts have been developed during earlier times.


Documentation you ask? Learn Perl, Python and Bash and you'll
understand the scripts.
