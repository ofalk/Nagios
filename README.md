Nagios
======

Nagios plugins and scripts that I've written over time and now
want to share with you. There are a lot of quite simple scripts
here, but they might help you.


Most SSH based scripts have been developed during my time at a
bigger company, where we had (root) SSH keys on all machines.


Most SNMP based scripts have been developed during earlier times.

To be able to use check_snmp_process_alarm_wrapper.pl, you have to
create a link next to the script pointing to check_snmp_process.
Both the Perl version as well as the C version should work fine.
C version available here: http://nagios.manubulon.com/

Documentation you ask? Learn Perl, Python and Bash and you'll
understand the scripts.
